This paper conducts an in-depth exploration of diverse image preprocessing techniques and their impact 
on police car detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The study encompasses 
methodologies such as opening, closing, noise addition, edge detection, color enhancement, and 
grayscale conversion. The objective is to unveil insights into how these preprocessing techniques 
influence the performance of CNN models in the context of police car detection
